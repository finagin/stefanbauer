My name is Stefan Bauer. You'll find me on Twitter at [@stefanbauerme](https://twitter.com/stefanbauerme). I'm a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, UI/UX enthusiast and bacon-lover. I live in Germany near Munich and I love PHP and awesome design. I am a big fan of Laravel, VueJS, InertiaJS and TailwindCSS - in short the LIT stack from the early stage.

In the end of 2018 I built [pingping.io](https://pingping.io), a simple and affordable monitoring SaaS application for everyone. I started to build it in public where I created a journal about it. For several reasons it's a commercial product now.

Some weeks before Laracon EU 2019, my buddy Bobby Bouwmann and me decided to write a book called [Laravel Secrets](https://laravelsecrets.com) where we share everything we know about the hidden and undocumented secrets of the Laravel framework.
